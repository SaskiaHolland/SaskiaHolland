# Master's Thesis: Interactive World Map of *On Kawara's Date Paintings*

As part of my Master's in Digital Humanities, I developed an interactive map that visualizes and allows comparison of artworks distributed across the globe.

The map enables exploring On Kawara's Date Painting Series by metadata such as title, artist, creation year, location, and materials. It was implemented using Python, Pandas, and Folium, and is deployed via GitHub Pages.
